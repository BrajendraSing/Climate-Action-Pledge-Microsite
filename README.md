## Functionality & Logic

### 1. Smooth Scroll to Form
- Clicking the "Take the Pledge" button scrolls smoothly to the pledge form.
- Adjusts scroll position to ensure form heading is visible.

### 2. Loading States Dynamically
- Fetches state data from the server (`/states`) and populates the dropdown.

### 3. Pledge Form Submission
- Prevents default page refresh.
- Validates required fields (`name`, `email`, `mobile`, `state`, `profile type`) and ensures at least one commitment is checked.
- Prepares pledge data with current date.
- Sends a POST request to the server (`/pledges`) to save data.
- Displays a **Bootstrap modal** showing a certificate.
- Clears form and refreshes **Pledge Wall** when the modal is closed.

### 4. Public Pledge Wall
- Fetches all pledges from the server (`/pledges`).
- Displays them in a table with columns: ID, Name, Date, State, Profile, and "‚≠ê Love for Planet".
- Automatically refreshes after each submission without duplicating rows.

### 5. Certificate Generation & Download
- Shows user‚Äôs name and number of selected commitments as stars in a Bootstrap modal.
- Uses `html2canvas` to convert the modal content into an image.
- Allows users to download the certificate as `certificate.png`.

### 6. Error Handling
- Displays inline error messages for invalid or incomplete form submissions.
- Catches errors for server requests and certificate generation.
